1. Sentiment Analysis
1.1 Cleaning using Stop Words Lists
We enhance data quality by filtering out irrelevant words using stop words lists. This step ensures that the analysis focuses on meaningful content.

1.2 Creating Dictionary of Positive and Negative Words
A custom lexicon of positive and negative words is developed to accurately gauge the sentiment of the text. This dictionary is essential for the subsequent sentiment scoring process.

1.3 Extracting Derived Variables
Key variables such as sentiment scores, positivity/negativity ratios, and more are extracted to enrich the sentiment analysis.

2. Analysis of Readability
Readability analysis is conducted to ensure the text is accessible to a wide audience. Metrics such as Flesch Reading Ease and others are used to evaluate readability.

3. Average Number of Words Per Sentence
The average number of words per sentence is calculated to assess the readability and flow of the text. Shorter sentences generally enhance readability.

4. Complex Word Count
Complex words (words with three or more syllables) are counted to balance text sophistication and readability. This metric helps in understanding the complexity of the text.

5. Word Count
The total number of words in the text is counted to provide a comprehensive overview of the content volume.

6. Syllable Count Per Word
The average number of syllables per word is calculated to further understand readability levels. Fewer syllables per word generally indicate higher readability.

7. Personal Pronouns
The usage patterns of personal pronouns (e.g., I, you, he, she) are identified to understand the engagement and tone of the text.

8. Average Word Length
The average word length is analyzed to draw insights on text simplicity and complexity. Shorter words usually contribute to higher readability.
